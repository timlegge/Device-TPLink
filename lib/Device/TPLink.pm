=item * IT Nerd Space

L<http://itnerd.space/2017/01/22/how-to-control-your-tp-link-hs100-smartplug-from-internet/>

Original blog post that I found that gave me the idea to write a Perl module.

=item * softScheck's "tplink-smartplug" project on GitHub

L<https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug>

Great documentation on the TP-Link smart plug devices, including a more-or-less complete documentation of the JSON API.

=item * GadgetReactor's "pyHS100" project on GitHub

L<https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100/>

A python library to control TP-Link gear. Their issue tracker gave me the details needed to communicate with the device directly over TCP.
